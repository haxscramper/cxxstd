Nim wrapper for C++ standard library

NOTE: currently WIP, depends on implementation progress of [[https://github.com/haxscramper/hcparse][hcparse]]. Since
C++ stdlib was writted by people who are paid to come up with ways to
justifty usage of every single possible language feature there is it will
take some time. For now some most important basic types are wrapped
manually.
